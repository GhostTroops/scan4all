# Changelog

## Unreleased

- "I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good." â€“ Michael Scott, Season 4, "Money"

## v0.6.1

- fix: Use NewEvent to init Event struct (#220)

_NOTE:_
A change introduced in v0.6.0 with the intent of avoiding allocations made a
pattern used in official examples break in certain circumstances (attempting
to write to a nil map).
This release reverts the change such that maps in the Event struct are always
allocated.

## v0.6.0

- feat: Read module dependencies from runtime/debug (#199)
- feat: Support chained errors using Unwrap (#206)
- feat: Report chain of errors when available (#185)
- **[breaking]** fix: Accept http.RoundTripper to customize transport (#205)
  Before the SDK accepted a concrete value of type `*http.Transport` in
  `ClientOptions`, now it accepts any value implementing the `http.RoundTripper`
  interface. Note that `*http.Transport` implements `http.RoundTripper`, so most
  code bases will continue to work unchanged.  
  Users of custom transport gain the ability to pass in other implementations of
  `http.RoundTripper` and may be able to simplify their code bases.
- fix: Do not panic when scope event processor drops event (#192)
- **[breaking]** fix: Use time.Time for timestamps (#191)  
  Users of sentry-go typically do not need to manipulate timestamps manually.
  For those who do, the field type changed from `int64` to `time.Time`, which
  should be more convenient to use. The recommended way to get the current time
  is `time.Now().UTC()`.
- fix: Report usage error including stack trace (#189)
- feat: Add Exception.ThreadID field (#183)
- ci: Test against Go 1.14, drop 1.11 (#170)
- feat: Limit reading bytes from request bodies (#168)
- **[breaking]** fix: Rename fasthttp integration package sentryhttp => sentryfasthttp  
  The current recommendation is to use a named import, in which case existing
  code should not require any change:
  ```go
  package main

  import (
  	"fmt"

  	"github.com/getsentry/sentry-go"
  	sentryfasthttp "github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/fasthttp"
  	"github.com/valyala/fasthttp"
  )
  ```

_NOTE:_
This version includes some new features and a few breaking changes, none of
which should pose troubles with upgrading. Most code bases should be able to
upgrade without any changes.

## v0.5.1

- fix: Ignore err.Cause() when it is nil (#160)

## v0.5.0

- fix: Synchronize access to HTTPTransport.disabledUntil (#158)
- docs: Update Flush documentation (#153)
- fix: HTTPTransport.Flush panic and data race (#140)

_NOTE:_
This version changes the implementation of the default transport, modifying the
behavior of `sentry.Flush`. The previous behavior was to wait until there were
no buffered events; new concurrent events kept `Flush` from returning. The new
behavior is to wait until the last event prior to the call to `Flush` has been
sent or the timeout; new concurrent events have no effect. The new behavior is
inline with the [Unified API
Guidelines](https://docs.sentry.io/development/sdk-dev/unified-api/).

We have updated the documentation and examples to clarify that `Flush` is meant
to be called typically only once before program termination, to wait for
in-flight events to be sent to Sentry. Calling `Flush` after every event is not
recommended, as it introduces unnecessary latency to the surrounding function.
Please verify the usage of `sentry.Flush` in your code base.

_NOTE:_
This version removes some of the internal APIs that landed publicly (namely `Hub/Scope` mutex structs) and may require (but shouldn't) some changes to your code.
It's not done through major version update, as we are still in `0.x` stage.

## v0.2.1

## v0.2.0

- feat: Add `SetTransaction()` method on the `Scope`

## v0.1.3

- feat: Move frames context reading into `contextifyFramesIntegration` (#28)

_NOTE:_
In case of any performance issues due to source contexts IO, you can let us know and turn off the integration in the meantime with:

```go
sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
	Integrations: func(integrations []sentry.Integration) []sentry.Integration {
		var filteredIntegrations []sentry.Integration
		for _, integration := range integrations {
			if integration.Name() == "ContextifyFrames" {
				continue
			}
			filteredIntegrations = append(filteredIntegrations, integration)
		}
		return filteredIntegrations
	},
})
