// InternalIterator iterates over a DB's key/value pairs in key order. Unlike
// the Iterator interface, the returned keys are InternalKeys composed of the
// user-key, a sequence number and a key kind. In forward iteration, key/value
// pairs for identical user-keys are returned in descending sequence order. In
// reverse iteration, key/value pairs for identical user-keys are returned in
// ascending sequence order.
//
// InternalIterators provide 5 absolute positioning methods and 2 relative
// positioning methods. The absolute positioning methods are:
//
// - SeekGE
// - SeekPrefixGE
// - SeekLT
// - First
// - Last
//
// The relative positioning methods are:
//
// - Next
// - Prev
//
// The relative positioning methods can be used in conjunction with any of the
// absolute positioning methods with one exception: SeekPrefixGE does not
// support reverse iteration via Prev. It is undefined to call relative
// positioning methods without ever calling an absolute positioning method.
//
// InternalIterators can optionally implement a prefix iteration mode. This
// mode is entered by calling SeekPrefixGE and exited by any other absolute
// positioning method (SeekGE, SeekLT, First, Last). When in prefix iteration
// mode, a call to Next will advance to the next key which has the same
// "prefix" as the one supplied to SeekPrefixGE. Note that "prefix" in this
// context is not a strict byte prefix, but defined by byte equality for the
// result of the Comparer.Split method. An InternalIterator is not required to
// support prefix iteration mode, and can implement SeekPrefixGE by forwarding
// to SeekGE.
//
// Bounds, [lower, upper), can be set on iterators, either using the
// SetBounds() function in the interface, or in implementation specific ways
// during iterator creation. The forward positioning routines (SeekGE, First,
// and Next) only check the upper bound. The reverse positioning routines
// (SeekLT, Last, and Prev) only check the lower bound. It is up to the caller
// to ensure that the forward positioning routines respect the lower bound and
// the reverse positioning routines respect the upper bound (i.e. calling
// SeekGE instead of First if there is a lower bound, and SeekLT instead of
// Last if there is an upper bound). This imposition is done in order to
// elevate that enforcement to the caller (generally pebble.Iterator or
// pebble.mergingIter) rather than having it duplicated in every
// InternalIterator implementation. Additionally, the caller needs to ensure
// that SeekGE/SeekPrefixGE are not called with a key > the upper bound, and
// SeekLT is not called with a key < the lower bound.
// InternalIterator implementations are required to respect the iterator
// bounds, never returning records outside of the bounds with one exception:
// an iterator may generate synthetic RANGEDEL marker records. See
// levelIter.syntheticBoundary for the sole existing example of this behavior.
// Specifically, levelIter can return synthetic keys whose user key is equal
// to the lower/upper bound.
//
// An iterator must be closed after use, but it is not necessary to read an
// iterator until exhaustion.
//
// An iterator is not goroutine-safe, but it is safe to use multiple iterators
// concurrently, either in separate goroutines or switching between the
// iterators in a single goroutine.
//
// It is also safe to use an iterator concurrently with modifying its
// underlying DB, if that DB permits modification. However, the resultant
// key/value pairs are not guaranteed to be a consistent snapshot of that DB
// at a particular point in time.
//
// InternalIterators accumulate errors encountered during operation, exposing
// them through the Error method. All of the absolute positioning methods
// reset any accumulated error before positioning. Relative positioning
// methods return without advancing if the iterator has accumulated an error.

	// SeekGE moves the iterator to the first key/value pair whose key is greater
	// than or equal to the given key. Returns the key and value if the iterator
	// is pointing at a valid entry, and (nil, nil) otherwise. Note that SeekGE
	// only checks the upper bound. It is up to the caller to ensure that key
	// is greater than or equal to the lower bound.

	// SeekPrefixGE moves the iterator to the first key/value pair whose key is
	// greater than or equal to the given key. Returns the key and value if the
	// iterator is pointing at a valid entry, and (nil, nil) otherwise. Note that
	// SeekPrefixGE only checks the upper bound. It is up to the caller to ensure
	// that key is greater than or equal to the lower bound.
	//
	// The prefix argument is used by some InternalIterator implementations (e.g.
	// sstable.Reader) to avoid expensive operations. A user-defined Split
	// function must be supplied to the Comparer for the DB. The supplied prefix
	// will be the prefix of the given key returned by that Split function. If
	// the iterator is able to determine that no key with the prefix exists, it
	// can return (nil,nil). Unlike SeekGE, this is not an indication that
	// iteration is exhausted.
	//
	// Note that the iterator may return keys not matching the prefix. It is up
	// to the caller to check if the prefix matches.
	//
	// Calling SeekPrefixGE places the receiver into prefix iteration mode. Once
	// in this mode, reverse iteration may not be supported and will return an
	// error. Note that pebble/Iterator.SeekPrefixGE has this same restriction on
	// not supporting reverse iteration in prefix iteration mode until a
	// different positioning routine (SeekGE, SeekLT, First or Last) switches the
	// iterator out of prefix iteration.
	//
	// trySeekUsingNext is a performance optimization that callers can use to
	// indicate that they have not done any action to move this iterator
	// beyond the first key that would be found if this iterator were to
	// honestly do the indicated seek. For example, say the caller did a
	// SeekPrefixGE(k1...), followed by SeekPrefixGE(k2...) where k1 <= k2,
	// without any intermediate positioning calls. The caller can safely
	// specify true for this parameter in the second call. As another example,
	// say the caller did do one call to Next between the two SeekPrefixGE
	// calls, and k1 < k2. Again, the caller can safely specify a true value
	// for this parameter. Note that a false value is always safe. The callee
	// is free to ignore the true value if its implementation does not permit
	// this optimization.
	// - We make the caller do this determination since a string comparison of
	//   k1, k2 is not necessarily cheap, and there may be many iterators in
	//   the iterator stack. Doing it once at the root of the iterator stack
	//   is cheaper.
	// - This optimization could also be applied to SeekGE and SeekLT (where
	//   it would be trySeekUsingPrev). We currently only do it for
	//   SeekPrefixGE because this is where this optimization helps the
	//   performance of CockroachDB. The SeekGE and SeekLT cases in
	//   CockroachDB are typically accompanied with bounds that change between
	//   seek calls, and is optimized inside certain iterator implementations,
	//   like singleLevelIterator, without any extra parameter passing (though
	//   the same amortization of string comparisons could be done to improve
	//   that optimization, by making the root of the iterator stack do it).
