Rod is a high-level driver directly based on [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol).
It's designed for web automation and scraping for both high-level and low-level use, senior developers can use the low-level packages and functions to easily
customize or build up their own version of Rod, the high-level functions are just examples to build a default version of Rod.

## Features

- Chained context design, intuitive to timeout or cancel the long-running task
- Auto-wait elements to be ready
- Debugging friendly, auto input tracing, remote monitoring headless browser
- Thread-safe for all operations
- Automatically find or download [browser](lib/launcher)
- High-level helpers like WaitStable, WaitRequestIdle, HijackRequests, WaitDownload, etc
- Two-step WaitEvent design, never miss an event ([how it works](https://github.com/ysmood/goob))
- Correctly handles nested iframes or shadow DOMs
- No zombie browser process after the crash ([how it works](https://github.com/ysmood/leakless))
- [CI](https://github.com/go-rod/rod/actions) enforced 100% test coverage

Please check the [examples_test.go](examples_test.go) file first, then check the [examples](lib/examples) folder.

For more detailed examples, please search the unit tests.
Such as the usage of method `HandleAuth`, you can search all the `*_test.go` files that contain `HandleAuth`,
for example, use Github online [search in repository](https://github.com/go-rod/rod/search?q=HandleAuth&unscoped_q=HandleAuth).
You can also search the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/go-rod/rod/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/go-rod/rod/discussions),
a lot of usage examples are recorded there.

[Here](lib/examples/compare-chromedp) is a comparison of the examples between rod and Chromedp.
