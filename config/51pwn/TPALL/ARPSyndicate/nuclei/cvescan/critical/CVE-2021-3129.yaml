  name: LARAVEL <= V8.4.2 DEBUG MODE - REMOTE CODE EXECUTION
  author: z3bd
  severity: critical
  description: Ignition before 2.5.2, as used in Laravel and other products, allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of insecure usage of file_get_contents() and file_put_contents(). This is exploitable on sites using debug mode with Laravel before 8.4.2.
