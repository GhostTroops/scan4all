  name: Cisco ASA Denial-of-Service # Leads to RCE
  author: dwisiswant0
  severity: critical
  reference: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43986
  description: |
    A vulnerability in the XML parser of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
    remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. It was also possible that
    the ASA could stop processing incoming Virtual Private Network (VPN) authentication requests due to a low memory condition.
