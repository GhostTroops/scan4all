  severity: high
  description: |
    Directory traversal vulnerability in cmsimple/cms.php in CMSimple 3.1, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the sl parameter to index.php. NOTE: this can be leveraged for remote file execution by including adm.php and then invoking the upload action. NOTE: on 20080601, the vendor patched 3.1 without changing the version number.
