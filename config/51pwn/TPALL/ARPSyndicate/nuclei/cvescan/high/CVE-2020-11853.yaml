    This template supports the detection part only.

    UCMDB included in versions 2020.05 and below of Operations Bridge Manager are affected,
    but this template can probably also be used to detect Operations Bridge Manager
    (containeirized) and Application Performance Management.

    Originated from Metasploit module (#14654).
