    A ZipSlip vulnerability in McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO)
    is a type of Path Traversal occurring when archives are unpacked
    if the names of the packed files are not properly sanitized.
    An attacker can create archives with files containing “../” in their names,
    making it possible to upload arbitrary files
    to arbitrary directories or overwrite existing ones during archive extraction.
