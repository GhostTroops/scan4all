id: CVE-2020-35951

info:
  name: Wordpress Quiz and Survey Master Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: princechaddha
  severity: critical
  description: |
    An issue was discovered in the Quiz and Survey Master plugin before 7.0.1 for WordPress. It allows users to delete arbitrary files such as wp-config.php file, which could effectively take a site offline and allow an attacker to reinstall with a WordPress instance under their control. This occurred via qsm_remove_file_fd_question, which allowed unauthenticated deletions (even though it was only intended for a person to delete their own quiz-answer files).
