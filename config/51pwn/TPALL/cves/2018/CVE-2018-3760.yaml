  description: |
    Ruby On Rails is a well-known Ruby Web development framework, which uses Sprockets as a static file server in development environment. Sprockets is a Ruby library that compiles and distributes static resource files.
    There is a path traversal vulnerability caused by secondary decoding in Sprockets 3.7.1 and lower versions. An attacker can use %252e%252e/ to access the root directory and read or execute any file on the target server.
