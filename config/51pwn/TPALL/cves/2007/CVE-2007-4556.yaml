info:
  name: Apache Struts2 S2-001 RCE
  author: pikpikcu
  severity: critical
  description: Struts support in OpenSymphony XWork before 1.2.3, and 2.x before 2.0.4, as used in WebWork and Apache Struts, recursively evaluates all input as an Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) expression when altSyntax is enabled, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) or execute arbitrary code via form input beginning with a "%{" sequence and ending with a "}" character.
