  name: NeDi 1.9C XSS
  author: pikpikcu
  severity: medium
  reference: https://gist.github.com/farid007/8db2ab5367ba00e87f9479b32d46fea8
  description: NeDi 1.9C is vulnerable to XSS because of an incorrect implementation of sanitize() in inc/libmisc.php. This function attempts to escape the SCRIPT tag from user-controllable values, but can be easily bypassed, as demonstrated by an onerror attribute of an IMG element as a Devices-Config.php?sta= value.
