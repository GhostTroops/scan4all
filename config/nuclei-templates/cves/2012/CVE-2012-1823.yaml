id: CVE-2012-1823

info:
  name: PHP CGI v5.3.12/5.4.2 Remote Code Execution
  author: pikpikcu
  severity: critical
  description: |
    sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in PHP before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2, when configured as a CGI script (aka php-cgi), does not properly handle query strings that lack an = (equals sign) character, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by placing command-line options in the query string, related to lack of skipping a certain php_getopt for the 'd' case.
