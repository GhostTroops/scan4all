# Remediation:
# Ensure that this permission is restricted to specific groups that require it.
# You can restrict it in Administration > System > Global Permissions.
# Turning the feature off will not affect existing filters and dashboards.
# If you change this setting, you will still need to update the existing filters and dashboards if they have already been
# shared publicly.
# Since Jira 7.2.10, a dark feature to disable site-wide anonymous access was introduced.
