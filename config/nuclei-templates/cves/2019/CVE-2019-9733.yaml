id: CVE-2019-9733

info:
  name: JFrog Artifactory 6.7.3 - Admin Login Bypass
  author: akshansh
  severity: critical
  description: JFrog Artifactory 6.7.3 is vulnerable to an admin login bypass issue because by default the access-admin account is used to reset the password of the admin account. While this is only allowable from a connection directly from localhost, providing an X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to the request allows an unauthenticated user to login with the default credentials of the access-admin account while bypassing the whitelist of allowed IP addresses. The access-admin account can use Artifactory's API to request authentication tokens for all users including the admin account and, in turn, assume full control of all artifacts and repositories managed by Artifactory.
