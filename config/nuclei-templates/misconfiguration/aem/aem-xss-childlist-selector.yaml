  name: Adobe Experience Manager - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: dhiyaneshDk
  severity: high
  description: |
    Adobe Experience Manager contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability via requests using the selector childlist when the dispatcher does not respect the content-type responded by AEM and flips from application/json to text/html. As a consequence, the reflected suffix is executed and interpreted in the browser.
